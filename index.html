    <h1>The exploration of outer space has led to many new discoveries. We have learned about the formation of the universe, the evolution of stars and planets, and the possibility of life beyond Earth. We have also developed new technologies that have benefited our lives on Earth, such as GPS, satellite television, and weather forecasting.

        The future of space exploration is bright. We are planning to send humans to Mars and beyond, and we are developing new technologies that will allow us to explore the universe in more detail than ever before.
        
        Here are some of the most interesting facts about outer space:

        Mars is about 4.6 billion years old.
        The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old.
        The speed of light is about 186,282 miles per second.
